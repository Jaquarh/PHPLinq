All I get then is \"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage\", however, I can just click on the back button and run another file without problems. I am running xampp with php version 5.2.5, apache version is 2.2.8.\n \nFeel free to move this post to discussions, I just wanted to explain the \"Hi\".",
